## Welcome in!

I'm Kia. I study Statistics at UWaterloo as a 3rd year undergrad student, and I am a research assistant at the RCS lab at UWaterloo. My current research is about predicting the failure of hard drives, and for achieving that, my work involves topics in:

- explorative data analysis
- data visualization
- survival analysis
- deep learning (recurrent neural networks and LSTM), and
- unsupervised learning.

I have recently become interested in agent-based intelligent systems (i.e., Reinforcement Learning) on the theory side. This interest is triggered in me due to my first imagery of Artificial Intelligence back in middle school.

My earliest exposal to AI involved developing tic-tac-toe-playing bots. Of course, it did not have to do anything with AI but hard-coding a dozen of case-based decisions, but that was enough to build in my mind a game theory mindset of what AI is used for and how it's developed. Now that I know the alphabet of intelligence, I can proceed to look at problems like multiplayer games.
